# my3dChameleon

A Configuration file for Klipper to use the 3dChameleon.
I use it on a Sovol SV06 Plus, you will need to adjust some things to make this work for your printer, even if you have the same printer.

Please follow the instructions of 3dChameleon from https://www.3dchameleon.com/instructions

This is work in progress. If you find any errors please open a issue or create a pull request.
