# my3dChameleon

A Configuration file for Klipper to use the 3dChameleon.
I use it on a Sovol SV06 Plus, you will need to adjust some things to make this work for your printer, even if you have the same printer.
If you have the SV06 / Plus you can find printable parts here:

I also uploaded a Remixed version of the extruder bracket without the bar to hold the y-adapter, I used a M6 PTFE coupler instead

Please follow the instructions of 3dChameleon from https://www.3dchameleon.com/instructions
